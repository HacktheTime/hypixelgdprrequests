# This is not done yet! This is just a placeholder where I will code the full programm later.

This is an tool to analyse the Hypixel Minecraft Server Data Response you can get from [here](https://hypixel.net/data-request/)

Keep in mind that this tool is specialised to MY needs. I will add the things **I** need. Feel free to make pull requests for additions.

I keep myself the right to include code from forks in the main project even without getting a pull request. If you have a problem with that write your own from scratch.
